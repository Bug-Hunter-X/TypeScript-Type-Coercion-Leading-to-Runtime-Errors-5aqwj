This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in TypeScript related to type coercion. The `add` function is declared to take two numbers, but because TypeScript allows implicit type coercion, it will compile without error even if you pass in a string.  However, this results in string concatenation, which may not be the intended behavior.  The solution demonstrates how to prevent this error using type guards or more explicit type checking.
